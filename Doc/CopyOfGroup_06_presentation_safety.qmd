## STUDY DESCRIPTION

Meta-data from MGnify’s vaginal microbiome genome catalogue

-   Uncover patterns in genome quality, taxonomic composition, and ecological characteristics.

-   Uncover potential patterns for diagnosis of endometriosis via associated pathogens:

    -   *Anaerococcus, Ureaplasma, Gardnerella, Veillonella, Corynebacterium, Peptoniphilus, Candida albicans, Alloscardovia*

## DATA CLEANING AND WRANGLING

:::: {style="margin-top: -15px; margin-bottom: -15px;"}
**Untidy –\> tidy data**

::: {style="line-height: 1.1;"}
1.  *Each variable is saved in its own column.*
2.  *Each observation is saved in its own row.*
3.  *Each "type" of observation is stored in a single table.*

### Untidy datafile

```{r}
#| echo: false   
print(readr::read_tsv(here("data/_raw/genomes-all_metadata.tsv")))

### Tidy data after augmentation

```{r}
#| echo: false

## DATA DESCRIPTION {.scrollable}

::: incremental
- 618 vaginal metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)
- 25 variables covering taxonomy, assembly quality, and geography
- High completeness and low contamination for most genomes
- Dataset dominated by a few major bacterial phyla
- Genome lengths fall within biologically expected ranges
:::

. . .

::: panel-tabset

## Phylum distribution

Most MAGs belong to only a few dominant phyla.  
This indicates strong taxonomic skew in the dataset.

---

## Completeness distribution

Most genomes have high completeness (>90%),  
indicating generally strong assembly quality.

---

## Genome length distribution

Genome lengths fall within the expected biological range  
for vaginal bacterial taxa (typically 1.5–3 Mb).

## ANALYSIS 1

## ANALYSIS 2

## ANALYSIS 3 - Associated and non-associated-endometriosis MAGs {.scrollable}

::: incremental
- Compared endometriosis-associated vs non-associated MAGs
- Focused on GC content, genome length, completeness & contamination
- Investigated whether associated MAGs cluster taxonomically
- Goal: determine if associated MAGs form a genomically distinct group
:::

. . .

::: panel-tabset

## Phylum distribution

Endometriosis-associated MAGs occur in only a few phyla.  
Most phyla contain *no* associated MAGs, suggesting limited taxonomic clustering.

---

## GC content

GC content ranges overlap almost completely.  
No evidence that GC% distinguishes associated vs non-associated MAGs.

## ANALYSIS 4 - Species Distribution between countries {.scrollable}

::: incremental
-   Investigating the distribution of lineage groups in Countries
-   Counted group instances for each country and wide format
-   Filtered for NA in Countries
-   Big difference in sample size --> normalize

:::

. . .

::: panel-tabset
## Heatmap

Some variation between countries. I.e. Order Bacteroidales, but not much.

Could've tested for significance.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Only two principal components --> 100% variance.

![](../results/PCA_variance_explained.png){width="60%"} 

Clear division of countries. 

Along PC1, Fusobacteria and Bacteroidota (order = Bacteroidales). Correlation with heatmap.

## DISCUSSION

- High-quality MAGs with good completeness  
- No strong genomic differences between groups  
- Limited metadata and uneven sampling


## FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

- Improve clinical + geographic metadata  



## CONCLUSION
