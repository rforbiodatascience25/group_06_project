## Direct link to presentation

Be sure to include a direct link to your presentation, e.g. the direct link to the lecture in lab 3 is: [`https://raw.githack.com/r4bds/r4bds.github.io/main/lecture_lab03.html`](https://raw.githack.com/r4bds/r4bds.github.io/main/lecture_lab03.html)

## Data retrieval

Since we are not putting data on GitHub, use the README to supply information on data retrieval

**Important: This entails, that the entire project as put on GitHub, can be cloned and then executed end-to-end. Since, we are not putting data on GitHub, if possible included programmatic retrieval of data and/or data instructions on how to easily retrieve the data, e.g. via login, in your GitHub repository README file**

#### But How???

Yes, we are not putting the data on GitHub, so either include programmatic retrieval of the data or state in your [GitHub README file](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/gfm.html), how you retrieved the data forming the base of the project.
